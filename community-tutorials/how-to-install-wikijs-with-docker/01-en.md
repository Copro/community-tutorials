# Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the process of installing Wiki.js using Docker Compose. By the end, you'll have a fully functional Wiki.js instance running in a Docker container.

The tutorial uses the example hostname `v11111111.quicksrv.de`. This hostname needs to be replaced by the name of your own server when you perform the workflow described in this tutorial.

# Requirements

- A Linux server 
- Basic understanding of shell commands.

The smallest netcup server meets these requirements.

# Step 1 - Install Docker Compose

If you haven't installed Docker and Docker Compose on your server, use the following commands:

```bash
# Install Docker Compose
apt install docker-compose
```

# Step 2 - Create a Docker Compose file for Wiki.js

Create a new directory for your Wiki.js setup and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir wikijs && cd wikijs
```

Now, create a `docker-compose.yml` file using your favorite text editor (e.g., `nano`):

```bash
nano docker-compose.yml
```

Paste the following text into that file:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  db:
    image: postgres:11-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: wiki
      POSTGRES_USER: wikijs
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: wikijsrocks
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  wiki:
    image: requarks/wiki:2
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      DB_TYPE: postgres
      DB_HOST: db
      DB_PORT: 5432
      DB_USER: wikijs
      DB_PASS: wikijsrocks
      DB_NAME: wiki
    ports:
      - "80:3000"
volumes:
  db-data:
```

In this configuration, we have defined the following parameters:

- We define the environmental variables to configure the PostgreSQL database.
- We map port 3000 inside the wiki container to port 80 on the host, making our Wiki.js instance accessible at http://v11111111.quicksrv.de.
- `environment`: List of environment variables set within the container.
- `POSTGRES_DB`: Name of the database to be created.
- `POSTGRES_USER`: Username for the database.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Password for the database user.
- **Note**: You should replace the password `wikijsrocks` with a secure password of your choice.
- `DB_TYPE`: Type of the database, here `postgres`.
- `DB_HOST`: Hostname of the database. Since the database is within the same Docker network, we use the service name `db`.
- `DB_PORT`: Port of the database, default is `5432` for PostgreSQL.
- `DB_USER` and `DB_PASS`: Credentials to access the database. These should match the environment variables of the `db` service.
- `DB_NAME`: Name of the database to be used.
- `ports`: Determines which ports are forwarded from the host to the container.
  - `80:3000`: Forwards port 80 of the host to port 3000 inside the container.

When using this Docker Compose file, you should as a minimum replace the database password with a secure password of your choice. All other configuration parameters can be adjusted according to your requirements and infrastructure.

# Step 3 - Starting the Wiki.js containers

Now, run the following command to start the Wiki.js and its database containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will download the necessary images and start the containers in detached mode.

# Step 4 - Access the Wiki.js installation

Once the containers are up and running, open your web browser and navigate to your server's address, e.g., http://v11111111.quicksrv.de. You should see the Wiki.js setup wizard. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

# Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully installed Wiki.js using Docker Compose. You can now start to effortlessly create and organize your documentation or knowledge base. However, remember to perform regular backups of your data and to keep your software up to date for security reasons.
